Flow.Launcher.Plugin.Add2Path
==================

A [Flow launcher](https://github.com/Flow-Launcher/Flow.Launcher) plugin
for managing your PATH environment variable.

> **Warning**: Dealing with environment variables is dangerous and can break things. Though I have tried to make this plugin as safe to use as I can, I cannot guarantee that it won't break or corrupt your PATH environment variable.
>
> **Use at your own risk. I am not responsible if this plugin breaks things for you.**

> **Important**: Editing the `PATH` (or any other system environment variables) requires administrator priveledges. This means that Flow Launcher will require administrator priveledges every time this plugin is used. To make FlowLauncher always run as administrator, see [#Running as Administrator](#running-as-administrator).

### Features

## Usage

- Add to PATH: `path add <item>`
- Remove from PATH: `path remove <item>`
- List all entries in PATH and copy to clipboard: `path list`
- Get current PATH value (semicolon delimited) and copy to clipboard: `path get`

> **Note**: There is no `set` command because I can't think of any practical use
> for it. Plus, completely overwriting your PATH can break a lot of things.
> If you really want to do it anyway, you can do it manually via the
> "Edit the system environment variables" screen.
